Auto-targeting system using image processing.
California State University class project.
Goal: 
    Auto-targeting system using image processing. This project will use white
    baloons on a dark background to simulate potential threats captured through
    a thermal scope. As such, the image processing scheme will recognize the 
    largest and brightest shape as the potential target; future versions will
    implement deep learning algorithms. Upon identifying the target, the UI will
    ask the user to verify if target is a threat. Once verified, a laser pointer
    mounted on two servos will track the target; future versions will have an
    airsoft gun (plastic pellets as projectiles) engaging the baloons.
